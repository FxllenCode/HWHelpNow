Hi, if your reading this, your smart. ;)

Well, you could also be observant, in which case congrats! 

If you thought you can stalk me here, you were wrong. Nice try. I'm just too big brain for you.

Best emojis because why not.

Fine... :(
Here is a song that represents me well:

Where is my angel
The end of the day
Someone come and save me, please
A weary sigh of a tiring day
I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The meaning of the tears reflected in the mirror
My color hidden with a smile, blue and grey

I don't know where it went wrong
Ever since I was a kid, I've had a blue question mark in my head
Maybe that's why I've been living so fiercely
But when I look back, I'm all by myself
That hazy shadow that swallows me up
Still, the blue question mark, is it anxiety or depression?
How am I so regretful?
Or maybe it's me that loneliness gave birth to
I still don't know, dark blue
I hope it doesn't erode me, I'll find an exit

I just wanna be happier
To melt the cold me
My hands have reached out countless times
Colorless echo
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself I just wanna be happier
Am I too greedy?

I felt when I walked on the cold winter streets
The sound of my fast heartbeat breathing
I still feel it
Don't say it's okay
'Cause it's not okay
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much

The way I usually walk and the light I always receive
But today it's a strange scene
Is it dull or is it broken?
But it's heavy, this lump of metal
Approaching gray rhino
I'm just standing there without focus
It's not like me at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in the God of confidence
Colorful words tickle
A large gray area is convenient
Gray with hundreds of millions of facial expressions here
When it rains, my world
Dancing over this city
It's foggy on a clear day
Always together on rainy days
Toast to all the dust here

I just wanna be happier
Feel the warmth of my hands
It's not warm, so I need you more
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
In the distant future, when I laugh
I'll tell you I did

After secretly picking up the words in the air
Now I fall asleep in the morning, good night

;)
At least it semi-represents.

(If you couldn't tell, it's Blue & Grey by BTS.)
